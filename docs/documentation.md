# Design Documentation for Project

This project houses jus one page  with the body displaying 6 different buttons.
Each button has starts the sequencer which is attached to and shows the values generated from the sequence
until no more values can be generated.

## Technical Documentation for Project
There exists a generator which holds each sequencer function and the values it produces.
There are 5 sequencers named:

#Application Design
Each Sequencer is a stand alone function which generates a sequence of numbers
A Limit of 15 is set on this Sequences 
A generator takes in the sequence function , executes it and keeps track of the values
via the .next() 

#FactorialSequence
A factorial sequence generates a list of numbers since it follows an arithmetic series, no input is taken

#FibonacciSequence
A fibonacci sequence generates a list of numbers using an arithmetic series , no input is takes  

#RangeSeq 
A Range sequence generates a list of numbers taking two inputs : Start , Step
Start - starting number to be generated by the list
Step  - difference between each number in the list

#PrimeSequence
A Prime sequence generates a list of prime numbers using an arithmetic series , no input is takes 

#PartialSumSequence 
A Partial Sum sequence generates a list of numbers taking an input : list
List  - an array of numbers
